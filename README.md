# Context
This repository contains the source code of Immuni's European Federation Gateway Client developed for the interoperability between national backend servers of decentralised contact tracing applications to combat COVID-19.

This client acts as a bridge between the Immuni backend and the federation gateway developed by the EU.

Its main purpose is essentially to allow the upload of the Italian TEKs and download the foreign TEKs from the [federation gateway service](https://github.com/eu-federation-gateway-service/efgs-federation-gateway).

In this way both Italian citizens who go abroad and foreign citizens who come to Italy are able to exchange their Temporary Exposure Keys and get notified if tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This makes it possible to extend contact tracing to foreigners travelling in Italy and to Italians travelling abroad, without the need to download additional apps.

More detailed information about the European Federation Gateway Server (efgs) can be found in the following documents:

- [Software Design European Federation Gateway Service](https://github.com/eu-federation-gateway-service/efgs-federation-gateway/blob/master/docs/software-design-federation-gateway-service.md)

**Please take the time to read and consider the other repositories in full before digging into the source code or opening an Issue. They contain a lot of details that are fundamental to understanding the source code and this repository's documentation.**

# Installation

### Prerequisites
 - [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) 
 - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

#### Maven based build
This is the recommended way for taking part in the development.
Please check, whether following prerequisites are installed on your machine:
- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) or a similar JDK 11 compatible VM
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

#### Build Docker Image
This project also supports building a Docker image.

To build the Docker image you need to build the project from the root:

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:immuni-app/immuni-efgs-gateway-client.git
cd immuni-efgs-gateway-client
mvn clean package
```
For local testing first ensure you have a MongoDB and Redis instances running locally, then fill the envar in the enviroment section of the ``docker-compose.yml``:

```
environment:
    MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb://user:password@mongodb:27017/EGFSDB-dev
    REDIS_URL=redis://:password@redis:15166
```
Also you need the EFGS server running locally, you can install it from the public repo [European Federation Gateway Service](https://github.com/eu-federation-gateway-service/efgs-federation-gateway).

To properly work the client needs also:

- an external signature service (rest API) ``SIGN_EXTERNAL_URL=https://host/v1/sign``.

- the certificate for the connection in mTLS to the European Federation Gateway Service (the country of origin must be defined in the "_country_" field of the certificate subject) and pack it into a Java Key Store.
```
environment:
      - EFGS_BASE_URL=https://example.dgc.eu
      - SSLEFGS_JKS_PATH=/security/sslclient/ssldgc.jks
      - SSLEFGS_JKS_PASSWORD=password
      - SSLEFGS_CERT_PASSWORD=password
```
- the certificate for the connection in mTLS with the external signing service and pack it into a Java Key Store.
```
environment:
      - SIGN_EXTERNAL_URL=https://host/v1/sign
      - SSLDP_JKS_PATH=/security/sslclient/ssldp.jks
      - SSLDP_JKS_PASSWORD=password
      - SSLDP_CERT_PASSWORD=password
```
- TrustAnchor to verify the signature of member state certificates and pack it into a Java Key Store.
``` 
environment:
      - TRUST_JKS_PATH=/security/truststore/truststore.jks
      - TRUST_JKS_PASSWORD=password
      - TRUST_EFGS_ANCHOR_ALIAS=anchor_alias
```

Once the requirements above shown are satisfied open a shell with working directory and execute

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```
